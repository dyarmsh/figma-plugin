# My First Figma Plugin!
Built using TypeScript and HTML (with internal CSS and Javascript) with guidance from Figma's plugin development course, accessible [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407531247639--BYFP-4-Building-Your-Plugin).

## Purpose
Currently, this plugin is built for a specific template provided by Figma to modify the contents of components and access variants with ease. This plugin is more suited for specific use cases for internal organisational design workflows.

## Future Improvements
I would like to expand the concept of this plugin to fit any use case:
- Any component can be selected from the file and its contents can be updated with ease whilst also accessing the various variants.
- Using text generation AI to make as many instances of components as we wish, with contents filled with AI (to then expand into image generation too).
